We present a cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing power spectrum analysis using daytime data (11am-11pm UTC) gathered by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over the period 2017-2022 (ACT Data Release 6). This dataset is challenging to analyze because the Sun heats and deforms the telescope mirror, complicating the characterization of the telescope. We perform more than one hundred null and consistency checks to ensure the robustness of our measurement and its compatibility with nighttime observations. We detect the CMB lensing power spectrum at $17\sigma$ significance, with an amplitude $A_\textrm{lens}=1.045\pm0.063$ with respect to the prediction from the best-fit Planck-ACT CMB power spectrum ΛCDM cosmology. In combination with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, this corresponds to a constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8=0.826\pm0.027$. The analysis presented here is especially relevant for ground-based millimeter-wave CMB experiments at the Atacama site, paving the way for future analyses making use of both nighttime and daytime data to place tight constraints on cosmological parameters.
