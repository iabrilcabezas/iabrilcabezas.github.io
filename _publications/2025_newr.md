We present a follow-up study to the method recently proposed by Namikawa & Sherwin (2023) to probe gravitational waves using cross-correlations between two CMB B-modes and a large-scale structure tracer. We first improve on the previous forecast by including the impact of CMB component separation and find that we can achieve $\sigma(r) \approx 3.5\cdot 10^{-3}$ by combining upcoming experiments, i.e., LiteBIRD, CMB-S4 and the Advanced Simons Observatory. With a more futuristic experiment, we can achieve even tighter constraints on $r$ if improved delensing can be realized. Using a simulated analysis pipeline, we also explore possible biases from higher-order terms in the lensing potential, which were previously not examined in detail. We find that these bias terms are negligible compared to a detectable signal from inflationary gravitational waves. Our simulated results confirm that this new method is capable of obtaining powerful constraints on $r$. The method is immune to Gaussian Galactic foregrounds and has a different response to non-Gaussian Galactic foregrounds than the $\textit{B}$-mode power spectrum, offering an independent cross-check of $r$ constraints from the standard power spectrum analysis.
