Â¡Hola! My name is Irene (pronounced /ee-<ins>deh</ins>-neh/) and I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge working with Prof. Blake Sherwin on topics related to lensing of the cosmic microwave background. This work is done as part of the [Atacama Research Cosmology](https://act.princeton.edu) and [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org) collaborations.
