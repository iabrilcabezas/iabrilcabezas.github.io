Â¡Hola! My name is Irene (pronounced /ee-<ins>deh</ins>-neh/, she/her/hers). I am a scientist passionate about Cosmology, outreach and diversity. My work currently focuses on studying the afterglow light from the Big Bang to learn more about the very beginning of the Universe and the subsequent distribution of dark matter across cosmic time.

At present, I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge working with Prof. Blake Sherwin on topics related to lensing of the cosmic microwave background. This work is done as part of the [Atacama Research Cosmology](https://act.princeton.edu) and [Simons Observatory](https://simonsobservatory.org) collaborations. My research is funded by the ["Mauricio y Carlota Botton"  Foundation](https://www.fundacionbotton.es) and the Cambridge Trust.
