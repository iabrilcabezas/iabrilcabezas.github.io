- **TV Interview La 8 Bierzo Magazine** as part of International Women's Day 2024. Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi7Hv8knSAA)!   
- **Invited interview** in [Innovadoras TIC](https://innovadorastic.org/blog/posts/irene-abril-la-astrofisica-espanola-que-estudia-los-secretos-del-universo).
- **[Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org) speaker**. Invited speaker to the I Soapbox science event in Spain. These events promote women and non-binary scientists. They use public spaces and transform them into a place where the public can interact first-hand with them. I wrote a post about my experience after the event [here](http://soapboxscience.org/2023/07/24/returning-home-roots-community-and-science/).  
- **Interviewed on the Spanish National Radio programme "La hora pódcast"**. In the interview, we discussed about the role women play in science. It was broadcast as part of International Women's Day 2023. You can listen to the interview (in Spanish!) [here](https://www.rtve.es/play/audios/la-hora-podcast/nuria-oliver-irene-cabezas-derroche-talento-cientificas-altos-vuelos-10-03-23/6826285/).
- **Mentor** of participant in [Maths in Cambridge internship programme](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/internships/philippa-fawcett-internship-programme) for women and non-binary students
- **Organising committee member of the [International Women's Day Event](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/about/equality.diversity/international.womens.day.ioa)** which took part in the Institute of Astronomy (University of Cambridge) in 2022. These events are a great celebration of women in Astronomy and a fantastic opportunity to reflect on how to attract more women to STEM areas.
- **Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics**. Organising committee for the [I Event for Undergraduate Women in Physics (Spain)](http://www.gemf-rsef.es/2021/07/01/i-encuentro-nacional-virtual-de-alumnas-de-fisica/). These events provide an incredible opportunity for undergraduates women to share experiences on being a woman in Physics while developing a long-lasting, supporting community around them. They are also organised across many other different countries (e.g. [UK](https://www.iop.org/conference-undergraduate-women-physics-uk-and-ireland), [USA](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/cuwip/)) and I very much encourage you to participate!
- **[Women in Science and Innovation](https://cientificasinnovadoras.fecyt.es) (Spain)**. Added to Mujeres en Ciencia e Innovación list, which features award-winning women scientists. The aim of this initiative is to give us visibility and showcase role models for the next generation of researchers.
